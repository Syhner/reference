# Problem solving approach

1. Examples (inputs, outputs, exceptions);
2. Pseudocode
3. Simplify and solve
4. Refactor (isValid function)

# Problem solving patterns

- Frequency counter: Comparing 2+ frequencies
- Multiple pointers: Evaluating array
- Sliding window: Looking at a slice of an array and adjusting it based on a condition
- Divide and conquer: Diving data set into subsets and processing them
